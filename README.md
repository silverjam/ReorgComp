ReorgCompare
============

A tool to prep directories (with source files) for comparison.  These will be
directories that should be very similar (e.g. two different snapshots of a
projects source code).  

The tool should be able to prep the directories by performing various known
renames and/or automatically detecting moved / renamed files.
